Title
    Comet for Highly Scalable Applications

Intro
    This is targeted at a medium to advanced audience, assumed knowledge of http

What is Comet
    what comet is from the client standpoint
    [ Diagram from client perspective, both long-polling and iframe streaming ]
    
A Comet Server
    holds on to connections, responds when it likes
    [ Diagram No implementation specifics, but show that it keeps active connections open. An expansion of Diagram from last slide (leave the client part there) ]
    
Scaling Vertically: Question
    How do you scale comet on a single machine?
    
Scaling Vertically: Broken Method
    Use threaded server such as Apache or IIs
    supports a few dozen users
    cpu + latency goes through the roof
    [ Diagram threaded]

Scaling Vertically: Answer
    Use event based architecture
    explanation
    Diagram


Scaling Horizontally: Question
    How do you scale comet servers across multiple machines?

Scaling Horizontally: Broken Method
    Keep state information
    Have Comet nodes directly communicate
    Embed Pubsub architecture
    [ Diagram of multi-node cometd install. Just show two comted nodes with channel/user/security info sharing data between themselves, next to the app and browsers ]

Scaling Horizontally: Answer
    Share Nothing
    Orbited
    [ Diagram of multi-node orbited install. ]


On Pub-Sub: What is it?
    description
    why you want it
    examples: chat rooms, stock quote info, etc.

PubSub Question: 
    How do you scale publish/subscribe horizontally?
    1. Distribute by user
    [diagram]
    2. Distribute by group
    [diagram]

PubSub Question: 
    But How, Specifically?
    Do not mix up with comet transport
        layer your architecture
        treat pubsub as a black box

Pub Sub Options
    IRC ( Internet Relay Chat )
        - Good for large groups
    XMPP (Jabber)
        - Good for presence
    JMS (Java Messenging Service)
        - Good for nothing [ TODO: put something useful here. ]

    How do you scale orbited dynamically
